# Piru

Piru puts doses, timestamped notes and estimated drug-level curves on one timeline. Its offline substance reference shows where each field comes from and lets you choose which sources take priority.

## Highlights

- Compare doses and session notes with estimated drug levels on one timeline.
- Import journals from PsychonautWiki Journal, DrugsPRO, and other apps that export in those formats.
- Official collaboration with [dose.wiki](https://dose.wiki/about), with its substance data available in the app.
- Inspect the sources behind each substance field and choose their priority.
- Keep the journal on your device, with exports and encrypted backups.

## Automation

Two actions in the Shortcuts app and Siri, for any automation that already knows what was taken. **Log Dose** saves straight to the journal and answers with the entry's id. **Start Dose Log** opens the quick log with the dose staged, and nothing is saved until you tap Log. Both take a substance (a brand like *Concerta* stays on the dose as its product), and optionally an amount, unit, route, time, meal, notes and tags.

The same prefill works as a URL from any app, always for review:

```
piru://quicklog?substance=Concerta&amount=27&unit=mg&route=oral&time=2026-10-18T09:30:00Z&meal=empty&notes=late&tags=work
```

`time` is ISO 8601 or epoch seconds; `meal` is `empty`, `light` or `full`.
