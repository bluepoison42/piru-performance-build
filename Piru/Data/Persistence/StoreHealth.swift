/// file is handed to an ORM that would otherwise abort *natively* on corruption.
///
/// Why this exists: SwiftData's `ModelContainer` open probes the schema with
/// `-[NSSQLiteConnection _hasTableWithName:]`, which on a malformed store aborts
/// the process below the Swift error layer — a `do`/`catch` around the container
/// open cannot save it (the build-30 `StoreRecovery.countUserRows` launch crash).
/// GRDB's own SQLite open plus a raw `PRAGMA quick_check` fails *throwably*
/// instead, so a corrupt store becomes a branch we can handle (quarantine,
/// recover, or launch in-memory) rather than a hard crash at launch.
///
/// The invariant this enforces at its call sites: **no SQLite file reaches a
/// SwiftData open without first passing `isReadable`.** Both the recovery probe
/// (`StoreRecovery.userDataCount`) and the live container open
/// (`StoreRecovery.openContainer(at:)`) funnel through here.
